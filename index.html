        <h2>History</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Solidity was proposed in August 2014 by Gavin Wood<sup>[11]</sup>. The language was later developed by the Ethereum project's Solidity team, led by Christian Reitwiessner.<br>

            Solidity is the primary language used to develop smart contracts for Ethereum as well as other private <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">blockchains</a>, such as the enterprise-oriented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperledger">Hyperledger</a> Fabric blockchain. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWIFT">SWIFT</a> deployed a proof of concept using Solidity running on Hyperledger Fabric.<sup>[12][13]</sup> </p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Solidity is a statically typed programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) or compatible virtual machines.<sup>[14]</sup><br><br>
            Solidity uses ECMAScript-like syntax which makes it familiar for existing web developers;<sup>[15]</sup> however unlike ECMAScript it has static typing and variadic return types. Solidity is different from other EVM-targeting languages such as Serpent and Mutan in some important ways. It supports complex member variables for smart contracts, including arbitrarily hierarchical mappings and structs. Solidity smart contract support inheritance, including multiple inheritance with C3 linearization. Solidity introduces an application binary interface (ABI) that facilitates multiple type-safe functions within a single smart contract (this was also later supported by Serpent). The Solidity proposal also includes "Natural Language Specification", a documentation system for specifying user-centric descriptions of the ramifications of method-calls.<sup>[16][17]</sup><br><br>

        <h2><strong>Criticism</strong></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Many security properties of smart contracts are inherently difficult to reason about directly, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing-completeness">Turing-completeness</a> of Solidity means that verification of arbitrary properties cannot be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem">decidably</a> automated. Current automated solutions for smart contract security analysis can miss critical violations, produce false positives, and fail to achieve sufficient code coverage on realistic contracts.<sup>[27]</sup> Solidity has been blamed for the error-prone implementation of Ethereum smart contracts due to its counterintuitive nature, its lack of constructs to deal with blockchain domain-specific aspects, and its lack of centralized documentation of known vulnerabilities.<sup>[27]</sup><br><br>
            In 2016, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University">Cornell University</a> researcher stated that Solidity was partially to blame for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)">The DAO</a> hack that took place that year. He stated: "this was actually not a flaw or exploit in the DAO contract itself: technically the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Virtual_machine">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a> (EVM) was operating as intended, but Solidity was introducing security flaws into contracts that were not only missed by the community, but missed by the designers of the language themselves."<sup>[29]</sup><br><br>
            The developers community often cites Solidity requiring much of third party interfaces and APIs, and its inability to create critical information intensive smart contracts.</p>
